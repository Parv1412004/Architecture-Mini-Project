# SIMPLE Assembler and Emulator

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **two-pass assembler** and an **emulator** for the **extended SIMPLE instruction set** as required in the **CS210 MiniProject (2024)**.  

The assembler translates SIMPLE assembly code into machine code, producing both object files and human-readable listing files.  
The emulator executes the generated machine code, simulating the behavior of the SIMPLE machine.  

---

## ✨ Features
- **Two-pass assembler**:
  - Parses SIMPLE assembly language.
  - Resolves labels and instruction opcodes.
  - Detects common errors (unknown mnemonics, missing/duplicate labels, invalid operands).
  - Produces:
    - **Object file** (`.o`) containing binary machine code.
    - **Listing file** (`.lst`) showing memory addresses, machine code, mnemonics, and labels.
- **Emulator**:
  - Loads the object file and simulates execution of SIMPLE instructions.
  - Handles arithmetic, memory access, branching, stack operations, and HALT instruction.
  - Produces optional memory dumps for debugging.
- **Test Programs**:
  - Sample assembler programs (`test01.asm`, `test02.asm`, …).
  - Demonstrates correct assembly, error handling, and execution.
  - Includes a **Bubble Sort implementation** in SIMPLE assembly.
- **SET pseudo-instruction** support (optional extension).

## ⚙️ Build Instructions
### Compile Assembler
```bash
gcc -std=c89 -pedantic -Wall asm.c -o asm
````

### Compile Emulator

```bash
gcc -std=c89 -pedantic -Wall emu.c -o emu
```

Or simply use:

```bash
make
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Assemble a Program

```bash
./asm test01.asm
```

Generates:

* `test01.o` → binary object file
* `test01.lst` → listing file

### Run on Emulator

```bash
./emu test01.o
```

Produces:

* Execution output on terminal
* Optional `test01.log` if logging is enabled

---

## 🧪 Example

```bash
./asm bubble.asm
./emu bubble.o
```

Runs the **Bubble Sort program** in SIMPLE assembly.
